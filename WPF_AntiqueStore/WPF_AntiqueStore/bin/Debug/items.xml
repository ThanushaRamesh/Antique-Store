    <itemDescription>This colorful painting entitled The Masked Ball, Ca Rezzonico, Venice, depicts a lively group of women, faces concealed with black masks, preparing for a ball. The women are most likely dressed for carnevale in Venice, a celebration for the victory of the Republica della Serenissima, in which a huge party was thrown in St. Mark's square to honor the military success of Venice in the war against Ulrico, Patriarch of Aquileia. This same celebration continues to this day.</itemDescription>

    <itemDescription>The leading portraitist of his generation, John Singer Sargent created unparalleled portraits of socialites, businessmen, artists, actors, writers and musicians throughout his long career, many of whom he counted among his friends. As a group, it was often his portraits of his friends and family that are considered among his most successful works, and this captivating portrait of the writer and art theorist Clementina Anstruther-Thomson is no exception. A close friend and student of John Singer Sargent, Anstruther-Thomson is captured here with a warmth and vivacity that reveals the regard in which Sargent held the Scottish author. Intimate and modern, it represents all the finest qualities of his very best portraiture.</itemDescription>

    <itemDescription>Austrian painter Eugen von Blaas’ unparalleled skill for genre painting is on display in this exceptional oil entitled The Water Carrier. The work captures a young Venetian woman during the course of her chores as she carries a filled water pail. Layer upon layer of fine glazes were applied to create the rich, blushing skin-tone of the Italian beauty, while her vibrant clothing lends an exoticism to the scene. She is the quintessential example of von Blaas’ preferred subject - spirited, salt-of-the-earth women who insouciantly engage in everyday tasks with the worn grandeur of the Italian countryside as their backdrop.</itemDescription>

    <itemDescription>A beautiful classical maiden lounges seaside in this original oil by John William Godward. Entitled By the Blue Ionian Sea, the work is exemplary of Godward's unique take on the Neoclassical style. Devoted to a segment of Classicism known as the Marble School, Godward's distinctive canvases are renowned for their Greco-Roman subjects placed within architectural settings inspired by antiquity. The cool smoothness of the marble and translucent gossamer of his subject's robes reveal the high degree of technical skill that sets Godward apart from his contemporaries.</itemDescription>

    <itemDescription>An exceptionally composed hammam scene comes alive in this composition by the master of the genre, Jean-Léon Gérôme. The splendid evocation of ladies lounging around the bath is offset by the steely gaze of Gérôme's primary subject, the white eunuch. Brilliantly conceived, the oil on canvas brings together Gérôme’s aptitude for narrative painting with his incomparable mastery of the highly finished Academic style.</itemDescription>
